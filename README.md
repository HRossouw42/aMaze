# aMaze 🧱

## The pitch 🎯

Play a maze game in your desktop browser, no matter the screen size!

## Controls 🎮

- Choose a difficulty to start the game
- Use W,A,S,D (or your arrow keys) to guide the 🏀 to the goal.

## Why does this exist? 🧑‍💻

- Made to wrap my head around random maze generation (using recursive functions)
- Using MATH to make the resulting output responsive on generation

## Resources used 🎨

- [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) for the 2D physics engine
- [PURE](https://purecss.io/base/) for the button css
- [Stephen Grider](https://twitter.com/ste_grider) for the basic maze generation tutorial

## Possible Improvements

- [ ] replace desktop with mobile friendly controls
- [ ] passive enemy obstacle generation (spikes!)
